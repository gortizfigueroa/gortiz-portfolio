## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gortizfigueroa/gortiz-portfolio.git
   cd gortiz-portfolio
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The portfolio will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔨 Build

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized build output will be in the `dist/` directory.

## 📝 Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server with hot module replacement
- `npm run build` - Build for production with TypeScript type checking
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checker without emitting files

## 🌍 Internationalization (i18n)

The portfolio supports English and Spanish. Language files are located in:

```
src/locales/
├── en.json    # English translations
└── es.json    # Spanish translations
```

### Adding a New Language

1. Create a new locale file in `src/locales/` (e.g., `fr.json`)
2. Add translations for all keys matching the structure of `en.json`
3. Update `src/i18n.js` to include the new language:
   ```javascript
   i18n
     .use(initReactI18next)
     .init({
       resources: {
         en: { translation: en },
         es: { translation: es },
         fr: { translation: fr }, // Add new language
       },
       // ... rest of config
     });
   ```

### Language Switcher

The Hero component includes a language selector dropdown that:
- Shows the current language (EN/ES)
- Dynamically updates all content when changed
- Closes automatically after selection
- Detects clicks outside to auto-close

## 🎨 Styling

The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling with a custom color scheme:

- **Primary**: Slate (900, 800, 50)
- **Accent**: Emerald (500)
- **Text**: White and slate variants

Configuration files:
- `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind configuration
- `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS plugins

## ♿ Accessibility

The portfolio follows web accessibility best practices:

- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards
- Focus indicators for keyboard users

## 🚀 Deployment

The portfolio can be deployed to various platforms:

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
vercel
```

### Netlify
```bash
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the dist/ folder to your GitHub Pages branch
```

### Kubernetes (`pck-cputeag`)

Pushes to `main` build an nginx image, publish it to GHCR, and deploy it to the `portfolio` namespace. The Service is **ClusterIP only**: there is no public ingress, NodePort, or DNS exposure. See [deployment and rollback](docs/deployment.md).

The full admin kubeconfig is stored in Infomaniak Public Cloud Barbican. GitHub Actions stores only the `OS_AUTH_URL`, `OS_REGION_NAME`, `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID`, and `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET` credentials used to retrieve it. The OpenStack credential is read-only and restricted to the one Barbican secret; the retrieved Kubernetes credential nevertheless has cluster-admin privileges.

For local access, install `kubectl`, `python3`, `python-openstackclient`, and `python-barbicanclient`, then configure the `openstack` cloud in `~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml` (mode `0600`). Run:

```bash
OS_CLOUD=openstack scripts/install-kubeconfig.sh --set-current
kubectl --context pck-cputeag-admin@pck-cputeag get ns
```

The installer preserves unrelated config entries, backs up an existing config, validates the merged file, and installs it atomically. `scripts/fetch-kubeconfig.sh` prints the path of a private temporary file; its caller must delete that file and parent directory after use. The original admin kubeconfig is retained locally at `~/.kube/pck-cputeag.orig` (mode `0600`), outside this repository.

> **Accepted credential-exposure risk:** during initial cluster setup, the current kubeconfig private key was printed into an AI assistant session transcript. The owner chose to retain this credential. Follow the [rotation runbook](docs/rotation.md) to replace it, and use the provider's revocation process if compromise is suspected.

## 📊 Performance Optimization

- **Code Splitting** - Components are lazy-loadable
- **Image Optimization** - SVG icons via Lucide React
- **CSS Optimization** - Tailwind purges unused styles
- **Build Optimization** - Vite's esbuild for fast bundling

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

- Supabase integration is configured but not actively used (can be removed if not needed)
- Contact form sends emails via i18n translations (no backend form submission)

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Currently, no environment variables are required for basic functionality. If using Supabase, create a `.env.local`:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```
